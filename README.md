# Age and Gender Detection using VGGFace: A Deep Learning-Based Facial Attribute Estimation

This project applies deep learning techniques to estimate **age** and classify **gender** from facial images using the **VGGFace model** with **transfer learning**. Designed for applications in **smart systems**, **surveillance**, **personalization**, and **demographic analytics**, the model is optimized to handle variations in lighting, pose, and facial features for reliable predictions.


ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

Accurate age and gender estimation is crucial for modern AI systems in areas such as security, targeted advertising, and human-computer interaction. This project aims to:

- Utilize the pre-trained VGGFace CNN for facial feature extraction.
- Fine-tune the model for simultaneous age regression and gender classification.
- Apply data preprocessing and augmentation for better generalization.
- Use the IMDB-WIKI dataset for training and UTKFace for cross-validation.
- Visualize predictions, evaluate performance metrics, and analyze errors.


ðŸ”§ **Technologies Used**
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)
